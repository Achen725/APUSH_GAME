PROJECT TITLE: APUSH Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The game was created to make fun of the experiences my friends and I went through after taking AP US History. It was intended to make fun of the struggles everyone went through in the vigorous course. 

VERSION or DATE: Version 1.0  
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Create the frame and set the dimensions. Then create the location of the obstacles and use the Image.IO extension to make the graphics appear. You need to create a way to detect collisions and a way to prevent the user from moving off the screen. Lastly add in keyListener and actionListener so whenever you press the move keys the image is redrawn in a different position. 

AUTHORS: Andy Chen and Yura Lemin
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Use the arrow keys to move. Try and collect all the items(Energy Drink and Books) on each floor and on the third and final floor hand everything to the teacher standing in the top middle.
